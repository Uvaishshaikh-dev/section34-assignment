Problem Statement – Transpose of a Matrix 
In the Academy of NumMatrix, students are given a magical board represented as an N × M 
matrix. 
 The headmaster wants to flip the matrix along its main diagonal so that rows become columns 
and columns become rows. 
 This operation is called a Transpose. 
Your task is to help the headmaster by printing the transpose of the given matrix. 
Input Format 
1. The first line contains two integers N and M – the number of rows and columns. 
2. The next N × M numbers represent the matrix elements. 
 
Output Format 
● Print the transpose matrix (of size M × N). 
 
Constraints 
● 1 ≤ N, M ≤ 100 
 
● 1 ≤ arr[i][j] ≤ 10^4



CODE:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int N, M;
    cin >> N >> M;

    int arr[100][100];

    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < M; j++) {
            cin >> arr[i][j];
        }
    }

    for (int j = 0; j < M; j++) {
        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
            cout << arr[i][j] << " ";
        }
        cout << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}

Input 
3 3 
1 2 3 
4 5 6 
7 8 9 
 
Output 
1 4 7 
2 5 8 
3 6 9
