Problem Statement – Wave Form Traversal 
In the kingdom of NumMatrix, the Royal Messenger must deliver letters by walking through the 
castle halls. The castle is represented as an N × M matrix, where each room has a number. 
The messenger follows a wave-like path: 
● In the first column, he moves top to bottom. 
● In the second column, he moves bottom to top. 
● In the third column, again top to bottom. 
● This continues for all columns. 
Your task is to print the wave form traversal of the matrix. 
Input Format 
1. The first line contains two integers N and M – the number of rows and columns. 
2. The next N × M numbers represent the matrix elements. 
Output Format 
● Print the elements of the matrix in wave order traversal (space-separated). 
Constraints 
● 1 ≤ N, M ≤ 100 
 
● 1 ≤ arr[i][j] ≤ 10^4

CODE :

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int N, M;
    cin >> N >> M;

    int arr[100][100]; // since N, M ≤ 100 as per constraints

    // Input matrix
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < M; j++) {
            cin >> arr[i][j];
        }
    }

    // Wave traversal
    for (int j = 0; j < M; j++) {
        if (j % 2 == 0) {
            // Top to Bottom
            for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
                cout << arr[i][j] << " ";
            }
        } else {
            // Bottom to Top
            for (int i = N - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
                cout << arr[i][j] << " ";
            }
        }
    }

    return 0;
}

Input 
3 4 
1  2  3  4 
5  6  7  8 
9 10 11 12 
 
Output 
1 5 9 10 6 2 3 7 11 12 8 4
